    <h1>New one world</h1>
    <p>AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and make decisions like humans. In simple terms, AI is a way of making a computer, robot, or software think intelligently, like a human being.

Key Features of AI:
Learning – AI can learn from data (e.g., machine learning).
Reasoning – It can solve problems and make decisions.
Perception – It can see, hear, or sense the environment (like facial recognition or speech detection).
Language Understanding – AI can understand and generate human language (like me!)</p>
